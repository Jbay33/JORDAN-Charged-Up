## THE THINGS WE DID THE DAYS WE DID

1/11 -Justin found out how to put a sprite scene in a ui view

1/12 - Milo put the images into the sprite scene and added buttons

1/17 - John started working on the backend and created models for the matches and scouters and created a proper data model. Justin made buttons and completed navigation views for user flow. Milo started sizing issues and started utility classes for maintaining data and turning it into consumable forms.

1/18 - John and Justin worked through a lot of git related issues. Milo finalized changes to utility classes and types. 
also milo, being the epicest gamer of them all, added functionality to all of the silly little fields that justin made.

Ok so like when we are oging to go to robotics competition it is pain in bootyhole to get information on other teams so what we do is the thing where it like uhhhh uhm it is like uhhh hmmmm like you look at them and then when they do things you put it down. And instead of writing it down on paper like a CRINGe person we use the app!

## HOW

- In autonomus and the teleropated you can click the places where they clicked respectively 
- Upload to the interwebs and have no dublicate and **_cringe_** data
- Also QR codes i think
- Looks incredible
