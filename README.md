## THE THINGS WE DID THE DAYS WE DID

1/11 -Justin found out how to put a sprite scene in a ui view

1/12 - Milo put the images into the sprite scene and added buttons

1/17 - John started working on the backend and created models for the matches and scouters and created a proper data model. Justin made buttons and completed navigation views for user flow. Milo started sizing issues and started utility classes for maintaining data and turning it into consumable forms.

1/18 - John and Justin worked through a lot of git related issues. Milo finalized changes to utility classes and types. 
also milo, being the epicest gamer of them all, added functionality to all of the silly little fields that justin made.

1/19 - Milo did this. why did he do it? also, the entire project broke?

###### THE PROJECT

This is a scouting app for FRC events during the 2023 season in the Charged up game. Users are able to collect data about other teams, store it in a database and access it in a website. This app uses the HTTP protocol to comunicate with an API, which sends information to a database that can is consumed on the website [here.](https://robotics-scouting.vercel.app/) 

We hope to use this for the 2023 season and possibly make it public facing. Many teams currently use google forms or even paper to keep track of data. This is designed to put data in the most consumable form possible. 

## HOW

- Users enter in team numbers and match numbers
- Users enter in the exact locations on the field where they scored
- Users are able to save data in a way that persists
- Users are able to make requests to the API
- Users can manage data that is saved and clear it if needed
